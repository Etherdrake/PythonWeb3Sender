# PythonWeb3Sender

What is this program?

This is a very simple example of how to send a transaction from account A to B. If you change 'ftm' to a different RPC you can use this script on on other chains too like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. 

Why did you use the Fantom network? 

I used the Fantom testnet because:

- The Fantom Testnet is really fast
- It is easy to get FTM from the faucet 
- You can get FTM from the faucet every 5 minutes
- The faucet is almost never down (unlike Binance Smart Chain)
- Harry Yeh

Faucet: https://faucet.fantom.network/
Explorer: https://testnet.ftmscan.com/

Be aware that you can also use this script with Ganache CLI, I just preferred using a "real" testnet. 

Requirements:

- Python 
- Web3 (install by running "pip3 install web3" 

Updates:

More examples of web3 scripts will be shared in this repository due time. 

Warning:

Do not accidentally share your private key by sending your script to other people without removing it from the code!
